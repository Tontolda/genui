   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to GenUI's documentation!
=================================

This is the documentation of the GenUI backend framework. It is a
collection of web applications implemented with `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ and
`Django REST <https://www.django-rest-framework.org/>`_.

.. note:: Currently we are using Django 2.2 as it was the most stable version at the time of starting this project, but we will begin the move to Django 3.x soon.

.. todo:: add link to the paper and link the different repos too (docker and frontend)
