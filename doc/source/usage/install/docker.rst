Deploying a Docker Image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Likely the easiest way to deploy a production version of the GenUI application
is by using Docker images. You can build your own using modified GenUI source code
or you can use pre-made Docker images on Docker Hub. The process of deploying
and building GenUI Docker images is described and implemented in a `separate repository
<https://github.com/martin-sicho/genui-docker>`_.
