GenUI Usage Information
=======================

In this section, the :ref:`Installation Guide <install-guide-index>` will show you
how to setup the GenUI backend applications in various ways:

* directly using the source code from GitHub
* deploying the GenUI docker images
* installing the `genui` Python package and using it in an existing project

We recommend reading about the setup via source code first. That guide will tell you
more about the architecture of the GenUI software platform and how the source code is structured, which can be helpful
in other deployment scenarios and also if you think about extending the platform.

The :ref:`Usage Guide <use-guide-index>` is structured as a tutorial for developers who
would like to add new features to the framework. Using a few examples, this guide will
show you how to add new molecular generators, machine learning algorithms for QSAR modelling and chemical space visualization options.
