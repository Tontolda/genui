# About

This repository contains the implementation of the backend application used in the GenUI framework. The GenUI framework provides both API and GUI for molecular generators. Molecular generators can be integrated
as self-contained Python packages and manage their inputs, outputs and data storage through Python 
or REST API. The GenUI [web frontend](https://github.com/martin-sicho/genui-gui) uses the GenUI REST services to upload bioactivity datasets and download public bioactivity data
in order to build QSAR and generative models. The frontend application can also render 2D 
projections of chemical space using various methods. You can find out more about how to extend 
and use the GenUI framework in the documentation (TODO: add link).

You can deploy and test the whole GenUI ecosystem as Docker images 
(more details [here](https://github.com/martin-sicho/genui-docker)).
