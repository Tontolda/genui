Deploying a Docker Image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Likely the easiest way to deploy a production version of the GenUI application
is with the help of Docker images. You can build your own with the GenUI
frontend and backend source code or you can use our Docker images
on Docker Hub. The process of deploying
and building GenUI Docker images is described and implemented in a `separate repository
<https://github.com/martin-sicho/genui-docker>`_.
